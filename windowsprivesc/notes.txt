This room is presuming we have initial access to the machine.

Task1:
 - We are first looking a for a password for the user Julia.Jones

 	I looked the the previous powershell history to see if it was created using a command, the command I ran:

 	type %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt

 	from there I found that the user was created using powershell, and I got to see the password clearly. 

 	Password was: ZuperCkretPa5z


 - for the second part I had to find the password of db_admins. I looked at the web.config file to see if the credentials were stored while configuring the server.
 	
 	Command: type C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config | findstr connectionString

 	Results: I found the user thm-db with password: 098n0x35skjD3

 - the third part asked to find the flag on of the user's desktop. I tried running: 
 	cmdkey.list

 	and I found that the user mike.katz had a saved password ( a big no no)
 	this saved password was used to access the computer so simply I ran cmd.exe using the saved credentils.

 	command: runas /savecred /user:mike.katz cmd.exe

 	the flag was easly retrieved when I cd'd into his desktop. 

 - the next step was to find a password saved from a putty session.

 	looking into the registry I found that there was a session to "my ssh server".
 	looking uder there I found that the password was saved on putty for easier access, but it was saved in plain text so I easily retreived it from there.

 	password: Coolpass2021
